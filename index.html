                        <p class="article-paragraph">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
                            physicist named Alan Guth, with
                            a
                            new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
                            equations,
                            venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
                        <p class="article-paragraph">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
                            particles that should have
                            been
                            created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to
                            begin
                            with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space
                            itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
                            faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
                        <p class="article-paragraph">If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
                            heavens look uniform from
                            pole
                            to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
                            wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond
                            detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
                        <p class="article-paragraph">“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the
                            page and drew a double box
                            around
                            it.</p>

                            beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation,

                            with
                            telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the
                            Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
                            so-called <a class="article-link" href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a
                            universe being wrenched
                            violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second
                            old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
                            colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>

                            many, including Dr. Guth,
                            wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
                        <p class="article-paragraph">If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
                            science comparable to the
                            recent
                            discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would

                                <p class="article-paragraph">Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that
                                    posits the clash of a

                                    his model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.</p>
                                <p class="article-paragraph">Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for
                                    confirmation, noting
                                    that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic

                                        microwaves, which
                                        were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They
                                        won the Nobel Prize.</p>
                                    <p class="article-paragraph">Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves.
                                        He is one of four
                                        leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the
                                        South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement

                                        Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>
                                    <p class="article-paragraph">“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the
                                        ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been
                                        hooked ever since,” he said.</p>

                                    was polarized,
                                    meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
                                </p>
                                <p class="article-paragraph">This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational
                                    waves from inflation.
                                    Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would
                                    twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the
                                    polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.</p>
                                <p class="article-paragraph">Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
                                    differences in the temperature
                                    of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting
                                    thermometer.</p>
                                <p class="article-paragraph">“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>
                                <p class="article-paragraph">The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year
                                    burning up time on a
                                    Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might
                                    beat them to the breakthrough.</p>
                                <strong class="strong-subtitle">A Special Time</strong>
                                <p class="article-paragraph">The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr.
                                    Guth, staying up late
                                    in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the
                                    universe.</p>
                                <p class="article-paragraph">Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity,
                                    electromagnetism, and
                                    strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different
                                    manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest
                                    moments.</p>
                                <p class="article-paragraph">As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from
                                    grace, like some old folk
                                    mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one
                                    force after another splitting away.</p>
                                <p class="article-paragraph">That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
                                <p class="article-paragraph">Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the
                                    temperature falls below 32
                                    degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
                                </p>
                                <p class="article-paragraph">Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too
                                    long. In that case,
                                    space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.</p>
                                <p class="article-paragraph">Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind
                                    of antigravity, and the
                                    universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more
                                    space was created, the harder it pushed apart.</p>
                                <p class="article-paragraph">What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a
                                    trillion trillionfold —
                                    from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a
                                    cosmic eye-blink.</p>
                                <p class="article-paragraph">Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary
                                    particles and radiation. All
                                    of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of
                                    sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a
                                    free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”</p>
                                <p class="article-paragraph">Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr.
                                    Guth’s original
                                    vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down
                                    to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off
                                    other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.</p>
                                <p class="article-paragraph">So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother
                                    asking about going
                                    any deeper into the past.</p>
                                <p class="article-paragraph">We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning,
                                    because inflation
                                    erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are
                                    swept away, forever out of our view.</p>
                                <p class="article-paragraph">“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian
